## Implementation Details
The focus indicators are implemented in canvas.component.ts (lines 363-377):
- Uses :focus-visible selector (only shows when using keyboard navigation)
- Outline: 2px solid #6366f1 (indigo accent color per design spec)
- Outline offset: 2px (per accessibility spec)
- Box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.3) for enhanced visibility
- Active+focused state has different outline color (#a5b4fc)

Focus indicators also work for:
- Color swatches (stroke and fill colors)
- Thickness buttons
